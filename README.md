Dire che


- EDA has significally improved the performance of the model (MSE on the test set dimished by 21%). -> outliers handling and missing values handling
- Ensemble models showed much better performance with respect to linear regression (MSE on the test set dimished by 36%).

The best ensemble model (XGBoost) allowed to reduce MSE on the test set up to 36% with respect to the best regression model (Ridge).
